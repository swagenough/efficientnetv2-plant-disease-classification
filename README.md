# Plant Disease Classification System
This project is a plant disease classification system built using transfer learning with EfficientNetV2B0. It classifies images from 38 different plant disease categories by leveraging pretrained convolutional neural networks fine-tuned on the dataset. The model pipeline includes image preprocessing with data augmentation, early stopping, best-weight checkpointing, and experiment tracking via Weights & Biases. The final trained model can be exported for deployment or used for real-time prediction on new plant images.
